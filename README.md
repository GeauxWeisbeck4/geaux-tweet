A Twitter clone that was created by following along with the Egghead Tutorial, [Building a Twitter Clone with Next.js App Router and Supabase](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-twitter-clone-with-the-next-js-app-router-and-supabase-19bebadb) by [John Meyers](https://github.com/dijonmusters). This was a wonderful course that I recommend that anyone, who wants to learn how to use the new features of the Next.js App Router and Supabases together, should take this.

You learn all sorts of wonderful things, such as authentication with Supabase, how to use PostgreSQL functions and triggers, and even how to create server and client components with the app router in Next.js. The instructor goes into great detail on using Supabase and explains how to use the newish features of Next.js like App router. He helps you improve the user experience with little things like using the [React hook, `useOptimistic`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic), which is technically still an experimental feature.
